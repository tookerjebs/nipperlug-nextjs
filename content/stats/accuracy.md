# Accuracy

Reduces the chance of your attacks being evaded by enemy [Evasion](/stats/evasion).

## Overview

Accuracy works in opposition to enemy [Evasion](/stats/evasion) to determine hit chance:

- **Hit Chance**: Your Accuracy reduces the chance of enemies evading your attacks
- **Evade Penalty**: Evaded attacks deal zero damage

The hit rate formula is not fully documented, but generally follows the pattern:
`Hit Chance = f(Your Accuracy, Enemy Evasion)`

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** Weapons, Vehicles, Accessories and their upgrades (Extreme/Divine/Chaos upgrades), various progression systems
- **Temporary:** GM Buffs, Accuracy Potions

## PvE and PvP Variants

Accuracy has specialized variants for different content:

- **PvE Accuracy**: Bonus accuracy against monsters and NPCs
- **PvP Accuracy**: Bonus accuracy against other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total accuracy = Base Accuracy + PvE Accuracy
- **PvP Content**: Your total accuracy = Base Accuracy + PvP Accuracy

These variants stack additively with your base Accuracy.

## Notes and Tips

- **Force Gunner**: Offers significant accuracy bonuses via class bonuses
