# Add. Damage

Flat damage value added to all attacks after most of the calculations but before final damage modifiers.

## Overview

Additional Damage is applied as a flat increase to your damage output:
- Applied before final damage increase/decrease modifiers
- Works with both normal hits and critical hits

## Typical Values

Not a stat that is abundantly available across all progression systems in high enough amounts to make it worth investing in.

## Calculation

Additional Damage is applied in the damage calculation pipeline:

If you have:
- Base Damage after Defense: 50,000
- Additional Damage: 100

Result: `50,000 + 100 = 50,100` damage before final modifiers

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** Can be found scattered throughout various sources but in small amounts which makes it never worth investing in.

## Notes and Tips

- Becomes less impactful as base attack increases
- Can be effective for fast-attacking builds (for example Blader using his Offensive Short Buff)
- Not reduced by enemy % damage reduction but reduced by Damage Reduction (flat type)
