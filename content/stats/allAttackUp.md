# All Attack Up

Universal attack boost that increases both Attack and Magic Attack by an equal amount. All Attack Up is added directly to your base attack values, making it valuable for all classes regardless of their damage type.

## Overview

All Attack Up is added to both physical and magical attack values during the effective attack calculation:

**For Sword Classes:**
- Effective [Attack](/stats/attack) = Base Attack + All Attack Up + Skill Attack Bonus

**For Magic Classes:**
- Effective [Magic Attack](/stats/magic-attack) = Base Magic Attack + All Attack Up + Skill Magic Attack Bonus

This enhanced effective attack value then gets amplified by your total skill amplification and processed through the damage calculation.

## Understanding All Attack Up

**Example:**
- Base Attack: 5,000
- All Attack Up: 1,500
- Skill Attack Bonus: 800 (varies per skill)
- **Effective Attack:** 7,300

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** Accessories and their upgrades, most progression systems
- **Temporary Boosts:** GM Buffs, other Buffs (like Platinum buff, etc.)

## Notes and Tips

- **Universal boost:** Increases both Attack and Magic Attack equally

## PvE and PvP Variants

All Attack Up has specialized variants that provide additional attack power in specific content:

- **PvE All Attack Up**: Bonus attack power against monsters and NPCs
- **PvP All Attack Up**: Bonus attack power against other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total all attack up = Base All Attack Up + PvE All Attack Up
- **PvP Content**: Your total all attack up = Base All Attack Up + PvP All Attack Up

These variants stack additively with your base All Attack Up, giving you higher damage output in their respective content types.
