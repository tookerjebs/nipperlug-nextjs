# All Skill Amp.

Universal skill amplification that increases both [Sword Skill Amp](/stats/sword-skill-amp) and [Magic Skill Amp](/stats/magic-skill-amp) by an equal amount.

## Overview

All Skill Amp functions as a universal amplifier that adds to both sword and magic skill amplification simultaneously:

**For Sword Classes:**
Total Skill Amp = [Skill Amp](/stats/skill-amp) + [Sword Skill Amp](/stats/sword-skill-amp) + All Skill Amp

**For Magic Classes:**
Total Skill Amp = [Skill Amp](/stats/skill-amp) + [Magic Skill Amp](/stats/magic-skill-amp) + All Skill Amp

Your effective skill amplification is reduced by enemy resistance stats, but can be restored with Ignore Resist Skill Amp.

## Typical Values

All Skill Amp values vary based on equipment tier and build focus:

- **Early Game:** 25-75%
- **Mid Game:** 75-300%
- **End Game:** 300-500%+
- **Maximum Practical:** No hard cap, but diminishing returns vs. cost

## Sources

All Skill Amp can be obtained through:
- **Equipment** - 
- **Progression Systems** - Various systems offer All Skill Amp
- **Temporary Boosts** - Buffs, potions

## Notes and Tips

- **Universal Value:** All Skill Amp is valuable for every class, making it a priority stat
- **Resistance Interaction:** Subject to the same resistance mechanics as other skill amp stats

## PvE and Pvp Variants

All Skill Amp has specialized variants that provide additional amplification in specific content:

- **PvE All Skill Amp**: Bonus skill amplification against monsters and NPCs
- **PvP All Skill Amp**: Bonus skill amplification against other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total all skill amp = Base All Skill Amp + PvE All Skill Amp
- **PvP Content**: Your total all skill amp = Base All Skill Amp + PvP All Skill Amp

These variants stack additively with your base All Skill Amp before being combined with other skill amplification stats. This gives you significantly higher damage output in their respective content types.
