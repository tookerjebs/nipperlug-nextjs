# Attack

The foundation stat for sword-based classes (Blader, Warrior, Gladiator, Force Blader, Force Shielder). Attack serves as the base in the damage calculation pipeline, working together with All Attack Up and skill-specific attack bonuses to determine your effective attack.

## Overview

Attack is the starting point for all physical damage calculations. The game determines your **Effective Attack** by combining:

- **Base Attack** 
- **[All Attack Up](/stats/all-attack-up)**
- **Skill Attack Bonus** (additional attack from the specific skill being used)

This effective attack value then gets amplified by your total skill amplification and processed through the damage calculation.

## Typical Values

Please Note: These values can be increased further with various temporary buffs

- **Early Game:** 1,000-3,000
- **Mid Game:** 3,000-6000
- **End Game:** 6000+
- **Maximum Practical:** No hard cap, but balance with other damage stats for optimal efficiency

## Understanding Effective Attack

**Example:**
- Base Attack: 5,000
- All Attack Up: 1,500
- Skill Attack Bonus: 800 (varies per skill)
- **Effective Attack:** 7,300

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** Weapons and their upgrades (Divine/Extreme)
- **Secondary Sources:** a large number of progression systems offer Attack/All Attack boosts
- **Temporary Boosts:** GM Buffs, potions, other Buffs (like Platinum buff, etc.) 

## Notes and Tips

- **Weapon upgrades** provide a significant Attack increases
- **Each skill** provides its own attack bonus that varies by skill level and type
- **Variance applies:** Sword damage has 20% variance (0.80x to 1.0x) for normal hits only

## PvE and PvP Variants

Attack has specialized variants that provide additional damage in specific content:

- **PvE Attack**: Bonus damage against monsters and NPCs
- **PvP Attack**: Bonus damage against other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total attack = Base Attack + PvE Attack
- **PvP Content**: Your total attack = Base Attack + PvP Attack  

These variants stack additively with your base Attack, giving you higher damage output in their respective content types.

## Related Stats

- [All Attack Up](/stats/all-attack-up) - Universal attack boost added to base Attack
- [Magic Attack](/stats/magic-attack) - Equivalent foundation stat for magic classes

## Class-Specific Usage

**Magic Classes (do not use Attack):**
- Wizard, Dark Mage, Force Archer, Force Gunner use [Magic Attack](/stats/magic-attack) instead
