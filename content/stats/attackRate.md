# Attack Rate

Attack Rate icnreases your chance to get past enemy blocks. The higher your Attack Rate compared to the enemy's [Defense Rate](/stats/defense-rate), the less likely your attacks will be blocked for zero damage.

## Overview

Attack Rate works against enemy Defense Rate in a blocking system. Higher Attack Rate reduces the chance of your attacks being blocked.

**Block Chance Formula:**

The exact formula is unknown, but it's a function that considers both your Attack Rate and the enemy's Defense Rate.

`Block Chance = f(Your Attack Rate, Enemy Defense Rate)`


## Sources

- **Equipment:** Weapons and their upgrades (extreme/divine), Accessories and their upgrades
- **Progression Systems:** Most progression systems offer this stat
- **Passives:** General and Class Specific Passive Skills
- **Temporary:** GM Buffs, Potions

## Key Mechanics

- **Block Prevention:** Higher Attack Rate reduces enemy block chance against your attacks
- **All Attack Types:** Applies to both physical attacks and magic attacks
- **Hit Guarantee:** 5% of attacks will always hit regardless of Defense Rate

## Related Stats

- [Defense Rate](/stats/defense-rate) - Defensive stat that opposes Attack Rate
- [Accuracy](/stats/accuracy) - Ensures your unblocked attacks actually hit the target

## Usage Notes

- Effectiveness varies based on enemy Defense Rate
- Essential for consistent damage output in both PvE and PvP

## PvE and Pvp Variants

Attack Rate has specialized variants that provide additional accuracy in specific content:

- **PvE Attack Rate**: Bonus hit accuracy against monsters and NPCs
- **PvP Attack Rate**: Bonus hit accuracy against other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total attack rate = Base Attack Rate + PvE Attack Rate
- **PvP Content**: Your total attack rate = Base Attack Rate + PvP Attack Rate

These variants stack additively with your base Attack Rate, giving you higher hit success rates against the respective enemy Defense Rate in their content types.
