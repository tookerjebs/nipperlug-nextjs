# Boost HP Restoration

Increases the amount of HP restored by healing potions. This stat provides a percentage increase to potion healing effectiveness.

## Overview

 It only affects potion healing - not HP steal, auto heal, or skill-based healing.

**Healing Calculation**:
- **Base Potion**: Original healing amount
- **Enhanced Healing**: Base × (1 + Boost HP Restoration %)
- **Example**: 1000 HP potion + 30% boost = 1000 × 1.30 = 1300 HP healed

## Sources

- **Primary Source**: Carnelian (up to 30% at max level)

## Notes and Tips

- Only affects healing potions, not other healing sources
