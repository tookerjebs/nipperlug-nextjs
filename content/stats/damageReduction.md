# DMG Reduction

Flat damage reduction.

## Overview

DMG Reduction provides flat damage reduction. DMG Reduction subtracts a fixed amount from incoming damage, unlike Defense which reduces damage by a percentage.

## Counter-Stats

DMG Reduction effectiveness can be reduced by enemy offensive stats:

- **[Ignore DMG Reduction](/stats/ignore-damage-reduction)**: Bypasses your damage reduction
- **Cancel Ignore DMG Reduction**: Counters enemy ignore damage reduction (but only to 0)

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** Armor and their various upgrades (Divine, Extreme, Chaos)
- **Secondary Sources:** various progression systems, passive skills
- **Temporary Boosts:** GM Buffs, other temporary buffs (Platinum Buff, etc.)

## PvE and PvP Variants

DMG Reduction has specialized variants that provide additional protection in specific content:

- **PvE DMG Reduction**: Bonus flat reduction against monsters and NPCs
- **PvP DMG Reduction**: Bonus flat reduction against other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total DMG reduction = Base DMG Reduction + PvE DMG Reduction
- **PvP Content**: Your total DMG reduction = Base DMG Reduction + PvP DMG Reduction

These variants stack additively with your base DMG Reduction.

## Notes and Tips

- **Flat Reduction**: Provides consistent damage reduction regardless of incoming damage amount
- **Stacks with other defensive stats**: Works alongside other defensive stats for layered protection
- **Counter-Play**: Can be bypassed by Ignore DMG Reduction stat (which can be countered by Cancel Ignore DMG Reduction)
