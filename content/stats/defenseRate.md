# Defense Rate

Defense Rate increases chance to block incoming attacks, causing them to deal zero damage. This defensive stat works in opposition to enemy [Attack Rate](/stats/attack-rate).

## Overview

Defense Rate creates a blocking system that can negate attacks entirely. When you successfully block an attack, you take zero damage.

**Block Chance Formula:**
The exact formula is unknown, but it's a function that considers both your Defense Rate and the enemy's Attack Rate.

`Block Chance = f(Your Defense Rate, Enemy Attack Rate)`


**Block Chance Cap:**
- **Minimum:** 0% (you can always be hit)
- **Maximum:** 95% (5% hit guarantee - attacks can never be blocked 100% of the time)

## Sources

- **Equipment:** Armors and their upgrades (extreme/divine), Accessories and their upgrades
- **Progression Systems:** Most progression system offer this stats
- **Passives:** General and Class Specific Passive Skills
- **Temporary:** GM Buffs, Potions

## Key Mechanics

- **Binary Effect:** All-or-nothing protection - either blocks completely or doesn't
- **Hit Guarantee:** 5% of attacks will always hit regardless of Defense Rate
