# Evasion

Evasion increases your character's chance to completely avoid incoming attacks, mitigating 100% of the damage that would have been dealt.

## Overview

Evasion works in opposition to the attacker's Accuracy:

- **Evade Chance**: Your Evasion increases the probability of completely avoiding enemy attacks
- **Complete Mitigation**: When an attack is evaded, 100% of the damage is mitigated

The evasion formula is not fully documented, but generally follows the pattern:
`Evade Chance = f(Your Evasion, Enemy Accuracy)` 

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** certain accessories and their upgrades, various progression systems 
- **DEX:** Dexterity provides evasion in varying amounts depending on your class
