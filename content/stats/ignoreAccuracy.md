# Ignore Accuracy

Reduces enemy [Accuracy](/stats/accuracy) by the same amount.

## Overview

Ignore Accuracy counters enemy [Accuracy](/stats/accuracy) stat, indirectly increasing your chance to evade attacks.

## How It Works

Ignore Accuracy directly reduces enemy Accuracy on a 1:1 basis, but can only reduce it to 0 (never negative).

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** various progression systems

## PvE and PvP Variants

Ignore Accuracy has specialized variants for different content:

- **PvE Ignore Accuracy**: Reduces accuracy from monsters and NPCs
- **PvP Ignore Accuracy**: Reduces accuracy from other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total ignore accuracy = Base Ignore Accuracy + PvE Ignore Accuracy
- **PvP Content**: Your total ignore accuracy = Base Ignore Accuracy + PvP Ignore Accuracy

These variants stack additively with your base Ignore Accuracy.

## Notes and Tips

- **Defensive Counter-Stat**: Indirectly boosts your evasion effectiveness
- **Cannot Go Negative**: Can only reduce enemy accuracy to 0, not below
