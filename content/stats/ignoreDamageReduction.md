# Ignore DMG Reduction

Bypasses enemy [DMG Reduction](/stats/damage-reduction) effects.

## Overview

Ignore DMG Reduction counters enemy [DMG Reduction](/stats/damage-reduction) stat.

## How It Works

Ignore DMG Reduction directly reduces enemy DMG Reduction on a 1:1 basis, but can only reduce it to 0 (never negative).

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** various progression systems

## PvE and PvP Variants

Ignore DMG Reduction has specialized variants for different content:

- **PvE Ignore DMG Reduction**: Bypasses damage reduction from monsters and NPCs
- **PvP Ignore DMG Reduction**: Bypasses damage reduction from other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total ignore DMG reduction = Base Ignore DMG Reduction + PvE Ignore DMG Reduction
- **PvP Content**: Your total ignore DMG reduction = Base Ignore DMG Reduction + PvP Ignore DMG Reduction

These variants stack additively with your base Ignore DMG Reduction.
