# Ignore Evasion

Reduces enemy [Evasion](/stats/evasion) by the same amount.

## Overview

Ignore Evasion counters enemy [Evasion](/stats/evasion) stat, increasing your hit chance against evasive targets.

## How It Works

Ignore Evasion directly reduces enemy Evasion on a 1:1 basis, but can only reduce it to 0 (never negative).

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** various progression systems

## PvE and PvP Variants

Ignore Evasion has specialized variants for different content:

- **PvE Ignore Evasion**: Reduces evasion from monsters and NPCs
- **PvP Ignore Evasion**: Reduces evasion from other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total ignore evasion = Base Ignore Evasion + PvE Ignore Evasion
- **PvP Content**: Your total ignore evasion = Base Ignore Evasion + PvP Ignore Evasion

These variants stack additively with your base Ignore Evasion.

## Notes and Tips

- **Offensive Counter-Stat**: Bypasses enemy evasion investment
- **Cannot Go Negative**: Can only reduce enemy evasion to 0, not below
