# Ignore Penetration

Reduces [Penetration](/stats/penetration) of your attacker.

## Overview

Defensive stat that counters enemy [Penetration](/stats/penetration) on a 1:1 ratio (100 Ignore Penetration reduces 100 enemy Penetration), helping maintain the effectiveness of your [Defense](/stats/defense).

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** Various Accessories and their upgrades, most progression systems
- **Temporary Boosts:** GM Buffs

## Notes and Tips

- Important defensive stat in PvE and PvP.
- Bosses in end game dungeons can have between 3000-6000 Penetration, making Ignore Penetration a critical stat for survival.
- Can be countered by enemy [Cancel Ignore Penetration](/stats/cancel-ignore-penetration)

## PvE and PvP Variants

Ignore Penetration has specialized variants that provide additional protection in specific content:

- **PvE Ignore Penetration**: Bonus ignore penetration against monsters and NPCs
- **PvP Ignore Penetration**: Bonus ignore penetration against other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total ignore penetration = Base Ignore Penetration + PvE Ignore Penetration
- **PvP Content**: Your total ignore penetration = Base Ignore Penetration + PvP Ignore Penetration

These variants stack additively with your base Ignore Penetration, giving you higher penetration resistance in their respective content types.
