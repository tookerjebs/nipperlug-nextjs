# Magic Attack

The foundation stat for magic-based classes (Wizard, Dark Mage, Force Archer, Force Gunner). Magic Attack serves as the base in the damage calculation pipeline, working together with All Attack Up and skill-specific magic attack bonuses to determine your effective magic attack power.

## Overview

Magic Attack is the starting point for all magical damage calculations. The game determines your **Effective Magic Attack** by combining:

- **Base Magic Attack** 
- **[All Attack Up](/stats/all-attack-up)**
- **Skill Magic Attack Bonus** (additional magic attack from the specific skill being used)

This effective magic attack value then gets amplified by your total skill amplification and processed through the damage calculation.

## Typical Values

Please Note: These values can be increased further with various temporary buffs

- **Early Game:** 1,000-3,000
- **Mid Game:** 3,000-6000
- **End Game:** 6000+
- **Maximum Practical:** No hard cap, but balance with other damage stats for optimal efficiency


## Understanding Effective Magic Attack

**Example:**
- Base Magic Attack: 5,000
- All Attack Up: 1,500
- Skill Magic Attack Bonus: 800 (varies per skill)
- **Effective Magic Attack:** 7,300

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** Weapons and their upgrades (Divine/Extreme)
- **Secondary Sources:** a large number of progression systems offer Magic Attack/All Attack boosts
- **Temporary Boosts:** GM Buffs, potions, other Buffs (like Platinum buff, etc.)

## Notes and Tips

- **Weapon upgrades** provide the most significant Magic Attack increases
- **Each skill** provides its own magic attack bonus that varies by skill level and type
- **No variance:** Magic damage always deals the exact calculated amount (unlike sword damage)

## PvE and PvP Variants

Magic Attack has specialized variants that provide additional damage in specific content:

- **PvE Magic Attack**: Bonus magic damage against monsters and NPCs
- **PvP Magic Attack**: Bonus magic damage against other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total magic attack = Base Magic Attack + PvE Magic Attack
- **PvP Content**: Your total magic attack = Base Magic Attack + PvP Magic Attack  

These variants stack additively with your base Magic Attack, giving you higher damage output in their respective content types.

## Related Stats

- [All Attack Up](/stats/all-attack-up) - Universal attack boost added to base Magic Attack
- [Attack](/stats/attack) - Equivalent foundation stat for sword classes

## Class-Specific Usage

**Sword Classes (do not use Magic Attack):**
- Blader, Warrior, Gladiator, Force Blader, Force Shielder use [Attack](/stats/attack) instead
