# Magic Skill Amp.

Amplifies damage for magic-based attacks (Wizard, Dark Mage, Force Archer, Force Gunner). This stat combines with general [Skill Amp](/stats/skill-amp) and [All Skill Amp](/stats/all-skill-amp) to create your total skill amplification.

## Overview

Magic Skill Amp works as a damage multiplier specifically for magic classes.

**Total Skill Amp = [Skill Amp](/stats/skill-amp) (from your skill being cast) + Magic Skill Amp + [All Skill Amp](/stats/all-skill-amp)**

This total is then used to amplify your base [Magic Attack](/stats/magic-attack) value.  The damage calculation system applies different bonuses based on hit type:
- **Normal Hits:** Get 25% bonus skill amp (`Total Skill Amp × 1.25`)
- **Critical Hits:** Use base total skill amp (no bonus)

Your effective skill amplification is reduced by enemy [Resist Magic Skill Amp](/stats/resist-magic-skill-amp), but can be restored with [Ignore Resist Skill Amp](/stats/ignore-resist-skill-amp) if available.

## Typical Values

Magic Skill Amp values vary significantly based on build focus, these are just some typical ranges:

- **Early Game:** 50-150%
- **Mid Game:** 150-400%
- **End Game:** 400-800%+
- **Maximum Practical:** No hard cap, but diminishing returns vs. cost

## Sources

Magic Skill Amp can be obtained through:
- **Equipment** - most equipment pieces and/or their upgrades can provide magic skill amp/all skill amp
- **Other** - most progression systems

## Notes and Tips

- **Synergy is Key:** Magic Skill Amp works best when combined with high [Magic Attack](/stats/magic-attack) values
- **Normal Hit Advantage:** Normal hits get 25% bonus amplification, making consistent damage very strong
- **Resistance Matters:** High-end PvP/PvE enemies often have high magic skill amp resistance
- **Cost vs. Benefit:** Extremely high skill amp has diminishing returns due to resistance

## PvE and Pvp Variants

Magic Skill Amp has specialized variants that provide additional amplification in specific content:

- **PvE Magic Skill Amp**: Bonus skill amplification against monsters and NPCs
- **PvP Magic Skill Amp**: Bonus skill amplification against other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total magic skill amp = Base Magic Skill Amp + PvE Magic Skill Amp
- **PvP Content**: Your total magic skill amp = Base Magic Skill Amp + PvP Magic Skill Amp

These variants stack additively with your base Magic Skill Amp before being combined with [Skill Amp](/stats/skill-amp) and [All Skill Amp](/stats/all-skill-amp). This gives you significantly higher damage output in their respective content types.
