# Max Crit. Rate

Determines the maximum critical hit rate your character can achieve, capping the effectiveness of Critical Rate stat.

## Overview

Max Critical Rate sets the upper limit for your critical hit chance:
- Base Max Critical Rate starts at 50% for all characters
- Your [Critical Rate](/stats/critical-rate) cannot exceed your Max Critical Rate
- Separate PvP and PvE variants stack with base Max Critical Rate
- Essential for builds focused on critical hit damage

## Calculation

Max Critical Rate caps your effective critical rate:

If you have:
- Critical Rate: 80%
- Max Critical Rate: 65%

Effective Critical Rate: `min(80%, 65%) = 65%`

## Sources

- **Primary Source:** Accessories (Bracelets, Amulets), Pet, Option Slots for Armor (Hand, Body), Costumes
- **Secondary Sources:** Master Craft Armor, Essence Rune, Vehicles
- **Temporary Boosts:** GM Buffs

## Notes and Tips

- Must be increased alongside Critical Rate for effectiveness
- More expensive to obtain than base Critical Rate
- Essential investment for critical-focused builds (which means all PvE builds)

## Related Stats

- [Critical Rate](/stats/critical-rate) - Base critical hit chance
- [Critical DMG](/stats/critical-damage) - Damage multiplier for critical hits
- [Resist Critical Rate](/stats/resist-critical-rate) - Enemy defense against critical hits
- [Ignore Resist Critical Rate](/stats/ignore-resist-critical-rate) - Ignore enemy resistances

## Class-Specific Notes

- **All Classes:** Benefit equally from Max Critical Rate increases

## Advanced Mechanics
