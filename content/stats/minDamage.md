# Min Damage

Reduces damage variance for sword classes by increasing the minimum damage floor. Only affects non-critical hits from sword-based classes. Critical hits of sword based classes are unaffected!

## Overview

Sword classes have natural damage variance of 80%-100% on non-critical hits. Min Damage increases the lower bound of this range, reducing the gap between minimum and maximum damage.

**Base Variance**: 80%-100% for sword classes

**With Min Damage**: Higher minimum percentage, same 100% maximum

## Class Application

**Affected Classes** (sword-based):
- Blader (BL)
- Warrior (WA) 
- Gladiator (GL)
- Force Blader (FB)
- Force Shielder (FS)

**Not Affected**:
- Magic classes (no variance)
- Critical hits (always 100%)

## Sources

- **Primary Source**: Equipment via option slots, Pet

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Basic DPS Impact for non critical hits
**Scenario**: Blader with 10,000 final damage per hit
- **Without Min Damage**: 8,000-10,000 damage range (20% variance)
- **With 10% Min Damage**: 9,000-10,000 damage range (10% variance)

**DPS Improvement**: Average damage increases from 9,000 to 9,500 (+5.6% DPS)

**Result**: More consistent damage output with 12.5% average DPS increase and 50% reduction in damage variance.

## Notes and Tips

- Only non critical hits of sword classes have this damage variance.
- It is an outdated stat that barely has any sources in the game. 
- Since all PvE builds are heavily crit focused, even for sword classes, it's not a very useful stat.
