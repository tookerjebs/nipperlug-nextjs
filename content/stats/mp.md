# MP (Mana Points)

Your character's total mana pool.

## Overview

MP serves as your character's resource for skill usage. Required for casting skills and abilities.

## Typical Values

It is recommended to get at least 1500 Mana to counter the Mana Freeze effect. You might have to go even higher than that depending on the mana cost of your skills, and BM3 synergies (some BM3 Synergies reduce your mana).

## Sources

MP can be increased through:
- **Base Stats** - Each level increases base MP
- **Equipment** - Accessories
- **Upgrades** - Various equipment upgrades like Divine Upgrades, Chaos Upgrade, etc.
- **Passive Skills** - Class specific and general passive skills
- **Buffs** - GM Buffs
- **Progression Systems** - many progression systems offer MP but requires a damage sacrifice

## Notes and Tips

- Magic classes have an easier time reaching 1500 MP
- You will encounter Mana Freeze in PvP (Force Blader) and PvE content, that's why it is important to have enough MP regardless of the content you are playing
