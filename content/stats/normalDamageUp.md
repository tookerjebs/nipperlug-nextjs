# Normal DMG Up

Increases damage of non-critical hits.

## Overview

Normal DMG Up amplifies damage for hits that are **not** critical hits. This creates two separate damage calculation paths:

- **Normal Hits:** Use Normal DMG Up multiplier
- **Critical Hits:** Use Critical Damage multiplier instead

The key advantage is that there are no Resist Stats against Normal DMG Up.

## Example Scenarios

**Consistent Damage Build:**
- Base damage after defense: 15,000
- Normal DMG Up: 80%
- **Normal Hit Damage:** 15,000 × (100 + 80) / 100 = 27,000

## Typical Values

Normal DMG Up values vary based on build strategy. 

## Sources

Normal DMG Up can be obtained through:
- **Primary Source** - Chaos Upgrades of Bracelets and Earrings, Various Progression Systems

## Notes and Tips

- **No Resistance:** Unlike Critical Damage, Normal DMG Up has no resist counterpart
- **PvP viability:** Normal DMG Up can be useful in PvP due to its lack of resistances
- **PvE viability:** Not recommended in PvE because of lower overall damage output compared to Critical Damage

## Class-Specific Notes

**All Classes:**

- Both sword and magic classes benefit equally
- No class-specific bonuses or penalties
