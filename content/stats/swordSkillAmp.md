# Sword Skill Amp.

Amplifies damage for sword-based attacks (Blader, Warrior, Gladiator, Force Blader, Force Shielder). This stat combines with general Skill Amp and [All Skill Amp](/stats/all-skill-amp) to create your total skill amplification.

## Overview

Sword Skill Amp works as a damage multiplier specifically for sword classes.

**Total Skill Amp = Skill Amp (from your skill being cast) + Sword Skill Amp + [All Skill Amp](/stats/all-skill-amp)**

This total is then used to amplify your base [Attack](/stats/attack) value.  The damage calculation system applies different bonuses based on hit type:
- **Normal Hits:** Get 25% bonus skill amp (`Total Skill Amp × 1.25`)
- **Critical Hits:** Use base total skill amp (no bonus)

Your effective skill amplification is reduced by enemy [Resist Skill Amp](/stats/resist-skill-amp), but can be restored with [Ignore Resist Skill Amp](/stats/ignore-resist-skill-amp) if available.


## Typical Values

Sword Skill Amp values vary significantly based on build focus, these are just some typical ranges:

- **Early Game:** 50-150%
- **Mid Game:** 150-400%
- **End Game:** 400-800%+
- **Maximum Practical:** No hard cap, but diminishing returns vs. cost

## Sources

Sword Skill Amp can be obtained through:
- **Equipment** - most equipment pieces and/or their upgrades can provide sword skill amp/all skill amp
- **Other** - most progression systems

## Notes and Tips

- **Synergy is Key:** Sword Skill Amp works best when combined with high Attack values
- **Normal Hit Advantage:** Normal hits get 25% bonus amplification, making consistent damage very strong
- **Resistance Matters:** High-end PvP/PvE enemies often have high sword skill amp resistance
- **Cost vs. Benefit:** Extremely high skill amp has diminishing returns due to resistance

## PvE and Pvp Variants

Sword Skill Amp has specialized variants that provide additional amplification in specific content:

- **PvE Sword Skill Amp**: Bonus skill amplification against monsters and NPCs
- **PvP Sword Skill Amp**: Bonus skill amplification against other players

**How it works:**
- **PvE Content**: Your total sword skill amp = Base Sword Skill Amp + PvE Sword Skill Amp
- **PvP Content**: Your total sword skill amp = Base Sword Skill Amp + PvP Sword Skill Amp

These variants stack additively with your base Sword Skill Amp before being combined with Skill Amp and All Skill Amp. This gives you significantly higher damage output in their respective content types.
